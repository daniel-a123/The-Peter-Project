						<p class="style3">
							Peter lives with his grandfather. One day, Peter goes out into the nearby meadow, 
							leaving open the garden gate. A little bird greets him, chirping from a tree branch. 
							A duck follows Peter into the meadow and starts swimming in the pond. 
							The bird and the duck argue with each other. A cat comes along and begins 
							stalking the bird and the duck. Just as the cat is about to attack, Peter warns them. 
							The bird flies to the tree and the duck swims to safety in the middle of the pond.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="style3">
							The grandfather comes out and reproaches Peter for being too near the forest and 
							warns him about the danger of the wolf. They return to the house with the gate safely 
							locked behind them. A wolf comes out of the forest and the cat goes up the tree. 
							The bird, still in the tree, carefully keeps a safe distance from the cat. The duck, 
							now back on shore, is attacked and eaten by the wolf in one gulp. The wolf circles 
							the tree trying to figure out how to get to the cat and the bird.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="style3">
							Peter, watching from behind the gate, grabs a rope. He climbs the wall and quietly 
							goes onto a tree branch; Peter tells the bird to distract the wolf. He forms a 
							noose with the rope and lowers it, catching the wolf by the tail. Peter ties his 
							end of the rope to the tree branch. Hunters emerge from the forest and shoot at 
							the wolf, but Peter convinces them to help take the wolf to the zoo, instead. 
							Peter triumphantly leads the way; the hunters follow with the wolf; the grandfather 
							joins them, grumbling; the cat tags along; and the bird flies overhead. At the very 
							end, you can hear the duck inside the wolf, because the wolf swallowed the duck alive.

							<h2>What is The Peter Project?</h2>
							<p> The Peter Project is an accessible display of important yet
								lesser known instruments. If we can get this website to spread across 
								multiple schools we hope that more music educators would teach more about these
								instruments and, hopefully inspire young musicians to play them.
